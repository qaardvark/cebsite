		<i>hallo</i>, this is a really random website called <b>çebsite</b>, now how did you get here, i don't know but you are here. <b>yay!</b>
		<br>
		<a href="https://atheodog.github.io">this is a link to this page</a>
		<br>
		<br>
		and this is a cool lizard.

		<p style="font-family:verdana;">
		hello, i don't really really don't know why are you here on this website, <br>
		but you are; so this website is really boring and funny at the same time: <br>
		boring, because there is nothing to do, fun, because it's the best website <br>
		ever. now i am wondering why are you on this website more than i was before <br>
		when i wrote the sentence "i don't really really don't know why are you here <br>
		on this website" because first: how did you found this website? searching <br>
		in a search engine? well i really doubt a search engine would show up this <br>
		website because it's so obscure and so random. now im sure your brain is <br>
		melting for the non-sense you are reading right now, well same! because a <br>
		normal human wouldn't usually read a really big text like this one for <br>
		nothing. did someone send the link of this website to you? or you randomly <br>
		typed in the url box? well well well now i am trying to figure out how you <br>
		don't want to brutally spit your internal organs out of your body and donate <br>
		them to someone.
